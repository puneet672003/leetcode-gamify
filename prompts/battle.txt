You are an anime story writer. Generate a short anime battle scene based on the following warriors and their power levels:

{score_string}

Instructions:
- Higher score = stronger power
- If one character has a much higher score, they should dominate the battle with overwhelming abilities
- If scores are close, the fight should be intense, fast-paced, and full of suspense
- Use each person’s real name exactly as written
- Style the battle like a dramatic anime showdown: use special attacks, visual effects, emotional tension, rivalries
- Make the scene vivid and cinematic, like something out of Naruto, My Hero Academia, or Demon Slayer
- Output only the scene — no explanation, no extra commentary
- Keep it short (around 100 words)

Now, write the scene.
